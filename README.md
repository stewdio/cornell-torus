Cornell torus
========================================================================
This demo is part of my ‚ÄúThree.js in a Hurry‚Äù collection‚Äîan effort 
to help fellow spatial computing folks get up to speed quickly with 
the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) WebGL-based 3D rendering library. 
This example contains a rotating 
[torus knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot) inside a 
[Cornell Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box) rendered live, 
complete with interactive controls for adjusting various parameters. 
The code is clean, commented, and contains links to relevant 
third-party documentation. This demonstration code is live at 
[http://stewartsmith.io/studies/cornell-torus/](http://stewartsmith.io/studies/cornell-torus/).  
  
  
How to: Download this code package
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you‚Äôre not familiar with GitHub, the easiest way to download this
code package is to click the green ‚Äú‚Üì Code‚Äù button near the top of this 
page. Choose the ‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù option.  
  
  
How to: Run this from your Mac desktop
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sadly, you cannot just drag and drop the `index.html` file onto a 
browser window to view this application from your own 
[Macintosh](https://www.apple.com/macos/) desktop. You‚Äôll need to spin
up a server and view the application from a URL like 
[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) instead. But don‚Äôt 
worry‚Äîthat‚Äôs easy!  

1. Open the **Terminal** application. (Just hit ‚åò + Spacebar, then type
‚Äúterminal‚Äù to search for it on your Mac. Once found, hit Enter to open 
it.)

2. Type `cd `&nbsp;(yes, with that space after it), then drag and drop this
whole code package folder that you‚Äôve downloaded onto the **Terminal** 
window‚Äîit will fill in the folder‚Äôs full path address for you. 
(You‚Äôll see something like `cd ~/YourName/Downloads/cornell-torus/`.) 
Now hit Enter to tell **Terminal** it must `c`hange `d`irectories to 
that folder.

3. Paste this into **Terminal**, then hit Enter: 
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. You are now running a web server on 
port `8000`. (You could instead use a different number to listen on a 
different port. This is handy if you need many servers running at once;
each will need to listen to a different port.)

4. Now you can visit this website at 
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and everything should be 
fine üëç  

When you‚Äôre ready to shut down the server, go back to **Terminal**  and
tap Control + C. That‚Äôs all!

Python 3 commands) see Mozilla‚Äôs
